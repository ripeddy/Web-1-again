<h1> How to Write a Position Description  </h1>



<h2>Purpose of the Position Descriptions</h2>

<p>A position description provides support to management needs in recruiting, selection, promotion, performance, 
appraisal and training. They serve as an excellent communication tool as well as expressing both responsibilities a
nd performance expectations. They also address provisions of anti-discrimination laws, American with Disabilities Act, 
the FLSA and state wage and salary laws to ensure your employment practices are not discriminatory and provide information 
for position evaluation under wage/salary plans.</p>

<p>Position descriptions differ from “job instructions” in their focus on the whole sense of position worth, rather than on
an explanation of minute details of each duty.</p>


<hr></hr><h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>Assemble relevant materials. Gather materials relating to the duties, responsibilities, and requirements of the position. 
These include previously written descriptions, related descriptions, recruiting requisition records, job instruction sheets 
and organization charts. Define the major purpose of the position. Determine the major purpose for which the position was 
reated. The major purpose is a summary of the principle function of the position. This is often called the Position Summary.</p>

<p>List essential functions and responsibilities. Detail the several important duties and responsibilities which, collectively,
support the primary purpose of the position.</p>

<p>List abilities requirements. Follow preparation of key duties and responsibilities, abilities requirements (sometimes 
known as job specifications) should be listed. The purpose of listing abilities requirements is to specify the personal
qualifications, skills, and abilities needed by an incumbent of the position. Each requirement must have a valid and 
demonstrable relationship to the responsibilities described, and should be essential to the satisfactory performance of
the work at a beginning level.</p>

<p>Following the itemized listing of position requirements, a generalized requirement of occupational abilities, experience
and/or education may be added if the requirements for knowledge, skill and ability would ordinarily be acquired through
such means. (However, a general requirement for a high school diploma or college degree in position descriptions
is sometimes found to be an inaccurate standard when specified requirements are examined.)</p>

<p>Integration paragraph. Position descriptions should conclude with a paragraph to integrate duties and responsibilities
other than those expressed in writing.</p>

<p>Review and approval. After a draft of the position description has been written, it should be reviewed with the employee(s)
whose position is being described. As an alternative, the supervisor may wish to have the initial input on the position
description prepared by the incumbent. The employee(s) and the supervisor should agree that the position is accurately
defined.</p>

<p>The final form of the position description should be reviewed and approved at least one level above the original 
supervisor.</p>
